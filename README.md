This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This my repository for the My Reads project in Udacity's react nanodegree. It will allow
a user to search an API and organize books into one of three categories:
* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

You can install and launch this project by running `npm install` and `npm start`
